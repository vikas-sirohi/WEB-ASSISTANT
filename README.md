# WEB-ASSISTANT
webAssistant is a real-time conversational app designed for intelligent, dynamic information retrieval. Built with Langchain, LangGraph, Groq, and Tavily, it processes user queries through multi-source search and synthesis, providing accurate and contextually enriched responses by leveraging a graphical structure.
# Overview
This project aimed to create an AI-driven assistant capable of providing high-quality, real-time answers by sourcing data from  Wikipedia and Tavily Search. By combining these results and leveraging the power of the Groq large language model (LLM), the app delivers answers with reliability and contextual depth. This innovative approach combines language models with structured data management, providing an edge in intelligent information processing.
# Key Features
- `Multi-Source Query Processing`: Handles queries by searching both Wikipedia and Tavily search engines, combining information from these databases.
- `Graphical Structure`: Employs LangGraph to structure data and responses, improving the flow of information retrieval.
`Real-Time Interaction`: Provides instant, conversational responses through a live processing pipeline.
`Enhanced Language Model`: Utilizes Groq LLM to synthesize a final answer from structured data, ensuring coherence and relevance in responses.
# Technology Stack
`Langchain`: Framework for connecting and managing language model interactions.
`LangGraph`: Enables a graphical structure for mapping and organizing search results and response structures.
`Groq`: A large language model that processes final answers by synthesizing data from multiple sources.
`Tavily`: Search integration that allows access to a range of additional knowledge beyond standard repositories.
`Wikipedia`: As a primary knowledge base for contextual and factual information.
Architecture and Workflow

# Future Improvements
`Integration with More Data Sources`: Expanding the data scope by adding more search engines and specialized databases.
`Enhanced Graphical Display`: Improving the user interface to display the graphical structure of information retrieval visually.
